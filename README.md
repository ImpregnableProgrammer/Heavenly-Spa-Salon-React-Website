# Heavenly Spa & Salon Website
Repository for the new Heavenly Spa & Salon website built using [React](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) app routing, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and the [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) plugin for [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/). Additionally, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) was used for proper code formatting, and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) for linting in VS Code. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) will be used at some point for containerization with an eventual goal of self-hosting or hosting in Google Cloud.
